# BookStore API 
## REST API ASP.NET developed using .NET CORE 5 for the purpose of learning and fixing concepts.

### üíª This API implements a CRUD of Books (at the moment), it is possible to get the listing or using the id. In addition, we can register new books or suppliers, as well as change data and delete the book or supplier through their id.


* In this project I worked with: 
  - Database connection through the Entity Framework.
  - Versioning endpoints with the AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning dependency in the controller approach.
  - Layered architecture. 
  - Swagger support using JWT.
  - CORS enabled.
  - Implementing authentication using a JWT Token, Identity and Claims use.
  - Files Upload (two different ways available (need to uncomment lines of code)).
  - Using Logging and Monitoring with Elmah and HealthChecks.
